# Python Geometric Shapes Library


**This Python package provides a collection of geometric shape models, including base classes for shapes,
as well as specific implementations for rectangles and squares. This library is designed to assist in
geometric calculations and shape representations.**


## Usage

**from models import Base, Rectangle, Square**


### Creating and using shapes

**Base**
- The Base class serves as the foundation for all geometric shapes and provides common attributes and methods.
  You can create custom shapes by inheriting from this class. It's goal is to manage **id** attribute in all future classes



**Rectangle**
 - The Rectangle class respresents a rectangle and inherits from Base.


**Square**
 - The Square class represents a square and is a specialized form of Rectangle.
